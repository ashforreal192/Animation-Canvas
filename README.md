# Animation-Canvas
----HELP REQUIRED----


I have worked on the JS file and made it ready as I could for the URLs of any images to be placed in it for it to be rendered in real time. But the web page isn't showing the images being placed in there.

So the objective is: To find out the reason why the images aren't showing up on the main page.
I will be very grateful to anyone willing to come up with a suggestion for this.
(Please verify your code before suggesting)

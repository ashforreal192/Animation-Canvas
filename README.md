# Animation-Canvas
----HELP REQUIRED----


I have worked on the JS file and made it ready for the URLs of any images to be placed in it for it to be rendered in real time. But the web page isn't showing the images being placed in there.

So the objective is: To place the URLs in the correct format, which would make it visible in the page.
(And obviously, if you find any fault in the code itself, don't hesitate to put your suggestions in the open)
